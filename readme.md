## Additional Unyson shortcode add-ons for Bootstrap 4 and UIKit 3

All customized and Custom unyson shortcodes should be uploaded to your template folder, path:

`/wp-content/themes/MYTHEME/framework-customizations/extensions/shortcodes/shortcodes/`


I strongly recommend not to make any changes in The unyson plugin folder.

After all, Unyson like any other normal plugin is constantly updated, new shortcodes are loaded, old ones are updated. I think you already understood that once your changes can simply get lost another updates.
